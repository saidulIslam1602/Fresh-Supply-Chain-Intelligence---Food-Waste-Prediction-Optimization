## Business Problem

The fresh produce industry faces significant challenges that impact profitability and sustainability:
- 30% food waste across the supply chain
- Manual quality assessment leading to inconsistent decisions
- Poor demand forecasting causing stockouts and overstock
- Temperature violations compromising cold chain integrity
- Suboptimal routing increasing transportation costs

## AI Solution

Four core capabilities that directly address these problems:

| Problem | AI Solution | Implementation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Food Waste | Computer Vision Quality Assessment | EfficientNet-B4 with 5-class quality prediction |
| Poor Forecasting | Time Series AI (TFT) | Temporal Fusion Transformer with uncertainty quantification |
